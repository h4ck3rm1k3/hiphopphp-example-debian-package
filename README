this is an simple skeleton hello world application
it was created using my debian packaging of hiphop php,

Unfortunaly my installer of the debian package is not CMakeLists.txt working 100% yet, but the building is, so instead of installing the resulting debian package you use
the build directory. For me it was the  /usr/src/hip

The command to generate the code was :
hphp -k1 -t cpp -f exec  --output-dir out  helloword.php

but the cmake was edited by me.

thanks to Remi_Woler  http://www.wolerized.com/ from irc.freenode.net on the #hiphop-php channel.

The Hello World app is here :
<?php

echo "hello world!";

?>
